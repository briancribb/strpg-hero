<p>In my travels, I’ve managed to get almost all of the old books from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Role_Playing_Game">FASA Star Trek Role Playing Game</a>. These books have been out of print for years, and you can only get them by finding someone on eBay who already has one. I’m actaully kind of amazed that I have them all in PDF as well.</p>

<p>I don’t want to distribute them to the entire world because they’re technically still under copyright. I’ll list the books for you though, because if you know what you’re looking for then most of this information is out there on the Internet.</p>

<p><img alt="Enterprise Sketch" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/enterprise-sketch-800-0d76cd0c3.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/enterprise-sketch-400-0d76cd0c3.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/enterprise-sketch-800-0d76cd0c3.jpg 800w" /></p>

<p>I’ve managed to get almost all of the FASA content on PDF. I’m providing these because they’ve been out of print for years, and you can only get them by finding someone on eBay who already has one. Just to be safe, these links will only be visible when you’re logged into the site. I don’t want to just give these things out to the World.</p>

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>
<p>Although we will be using the HERO system, much of the content will come from the old FASA game. You really got a sense of your character’s career, all the way from the academy to the current post.</p>

<p>It still used random dice rolls, however. A point-based system will provide control for players, but will balance the various races and skills. For example, Vulcan racial modifiers in the Star Trek RPG put them way ahead of everyone else. In the HERO system, they would have to spend points for their powers and advantages.</p>

    <p>The The second edition vastly improved upon the first. FASA filled in the blanks to provide a sensible timeline and a fantastic amount of story pulled from the original series. The Cadet's Orientation Sourcebook is the best source of general information about the setting, with the other two books acting as player and gamemaster manuals.</p>

    <p>The third item is a ZIP file with our custom packages and prefabs. They're all made to work with Hero Designer v3, so you should be able to just add the packages for race, culture and education before spending your remaining points. You may have to navigate through the folders to load the three prefabs, but after that you should be set.</p>

<h2>Source Books</h2>

<p>The RPG gives a well-rounded view of the Star Trek universe, but these expansions fill in the gaps. They were written by some of the same people who were writing Star Trek novels at the time, so you could just read them as content without worrying about the RPG at all.</p>

<p>These books can be used to flesh out non-player characters, or they can be used to change the setting of the game entirely. If we wanted to, we could play as klingons, romulans, orions or even civilian traders.</p>

<p>Each expansion has its own maps, timelines and world entries. They go far beyond the game mechanics by providing coordinates and information on trade routes. As an added bonus, FASA took great care in keeping the various timelines synchronized. There are a few things that don't quite match, but for the most part it's pretty solid.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Federation</h3>
    <p>The FASA system provided a better description of the Federation and its history than the TV shows. There's information on Federation planets, procedures, and how all the different cultures mix together. There's also an impressive timeline showing how the founding races developed almost in parallel before encountering each other. No, the Vulcan's didn't explore the entire galaxy alone and then go slumming around our star system. We all did that stuff together, as a group.</p>

    <h3>The Klingons: 2nd Edition</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Starfleet Intelligence Manual</li>
      <li>Game Operations Manual</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is basically a revised version of the 1st edition source book. They separated story from game mechanics to make for a better read, and generally cleaned things up. The Klingons from these books will be the ones we meet in the game, with one exception.</p>
    <p>We're not going to have human/klingon fusions or romulan/klingon fusions. It was an interesting way to explain the lack of head ridges in the original series, but we all know the real reason for that: makeup was expensive. In our game, klingons have always had the head ridges. The Imperial race from this book will be the only klingons we meet.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Romulans</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Starfleet Intelligence Manual</li>
      <li>Game Operations Manual</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So how did the Romulans wind up way across the galaxy before the Federation was formed? The shows, books and games say that the Vulcans have had space travel pretty much forever, but for some reason they didn't advance it for a few thousand years. Then they meet humans and they're ready to innovate again. I've never liked that explanation. It just doesn't fit with the rest of the Federation's story of cooperation and mutual growth.</p>
    <p>But FASA came to the rescue with a fantastic explanation. <strong>The Preservers</strong> did more than just move a few humans around. They saw the Vulcans on their pre-Surak path of self-destruction and took a few to Romulus as a way to preserve the species. These books read almost like a novel, and provide a deep and interesting view of Romulan culture. It was a pretty neat bit of writing when you consider that the authors only had two original series episodes to work from.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Orions: Book of Common Knowledge</h3>
    <p>Following the pattern of the other 2nd Edition source books, this expansion has a player's guide and a gamemaster's guide. This one is for players. It's all the stuff that the player characters might know about the Orions. It covers their history, their culture, and provides some details about those green animal women that we all know and love.</p>

    <h3>The Orions: Book of Deep Knowledge</h3>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Starfleet Intelligence Manual: Agent's Orientation Sourcebook</h3>
    <p>This book is part of a two-book suppliment that covers being a spy for the UFP. This is the player's manual. It's heavy on story and light on game mechanics, so it's a good read even though we're using the Hero system.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Trader Captains and Merchant Princes: 2nd Edition</h3>
    <p>This is probably my favorite expansion, because it tells us what happens in the Star Trek universe outside of the various military organizations. It gives us an idea of what those militaries are protecting.</p>
    <p>If we wanted to, we could abandon Starfleet entirely and play our game as a trade ship trying to make a living while avoiding pirates. It's certainly a good source for well-rounded NPC's.</p>

    <h3>Spacelanes: the Magazine of Interstellar Trade, 2nd Edition</h3>
    <p>This is the companion sourcebook for the 2nd edition of Trader Captains and Merchant Princes. It has <strong>lots</strong> of information about interstellar trade, and about the Triangle. It's a must-read for trader characters. Planetary Trade Profiles are explained on page 42.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Triangle</h3>
    <p>No, wait. <strong>This</strong> is my favorite expansion. It's a slice of independent space, surrounded by the three major powers. Pirates, traders, small governments at war, and various factions playing the big boys against each other.</p>
    <p>As an added bonus, much of it is unexplored. Until recent improvements in mining and agricultural technology, this place wasn't worth the trouble for the major governments to move in. It's a setting where everything is accessible, but the unknown is still available. It's most likely where our game will be set.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>These books are more like booklets, really. They were included with adventure modules, but provide some really interesting information about Federation history. These don't have game mechanics... they're all story.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Four Years War</h3>
    <small>From the adventure module: <em>Return to Axanar</em></small>
    <p>This war happened pretty recently, and saw the birth of phasers and photon torpedoes. The Klingons tried to gain a foothold deep in Federation space, and almost managed to keep it. Our game takes place less than a decade from the war's end, so some of the characters might be veterans. This is a must-read for anyone who plans to make such a character.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="book-list-item d-flex flex-column flex-column-reverse flex-sm-row mb-3">

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>The Romulan War</h3>
    <small>From the adventure module: <em>Old Soldiers Never Die</em></small>
    <p>This is older history, but it still tells a good story. Combined with the Romulans sourcebook, this gives players a pretty good idea of who the Romulans are in the FASA setting.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Ship Recognition Manuals</h2>
<p>These books have stats and diagrams of military and civilian ships going from the original series all the way to Star Trek III. But there's more to them than that. They also have historical data about when the ships were used and why.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Federation Ship Recognition Manual</h3>
    <p>You can find ships from the original series all the way up to Star Trek III in this book. It also has some interesting historical information about the Federation, including references to the Blue Fleet... which is a fleet of chips crewed almost exclusively by Andorians.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Gorn Ship Recognition Manual</h3>
    <p>This one is lighter than the others, most likely because the Gorn only appeared in one episode and most of what we know about them is guesswork from various authors. Still, they have a distinctive design here, and it fits right into the game.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Klingon Ship Recognition Manual</h3>
    <p>From the old D-7 battlecruiser to the fancy Bird of Prey that they received from the Romulans, this book has all of the best Klingon stuff that we would need.</p>

  <div class="mb-3 mb-sm-0">
    <h3>Romulan Ship Recognition Manual</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about this book is the information about how Romulan weapons developed, and how late the cloaking device came around. Cloaking devices were special in the Original Series, rather than a standard.</p>
