        <h1 id="about-the-game">About the Game</h1>
<p>This site is meant for a specific group of people, but I suppose anyone would enjoy the content. The idea is to have a Star Trek role-playing game, but using HERO system rules. The game will be set in the original series, and will use the timelines, settings and content of the old FASA game from way-back-when.</p>

<h2 id="why-fasa">Why FASA?</h2>

<p>Besides personal nostalgia, I have a deep respect for the work that was done by FASA. They had the entire Star Trek universe wrapped up and figured out, sensibly and rationally. They had souce books that read like novels, and their content was not only extensive, but deep. Simply put, it was good stuff.</p>

<p>I was always disappointed with the way the various television shows kept changing the timeline, often tossing out major portions of the history that we’ve known for years and replacing it with whatever they felt like. But to be fair, I suppose it’s easy for me to talk trash about TNG. I didn’t start a huge, expensive television show during a writer’s strike, and I’m not the one who was facing all those deadlines. They had to get the product out every week, and it turned out pretty well. Still, I wish they had been more consistent.</p>

<p>But I digress. This game will use the FASA setting. Wherever the television shows conflict with FASA, I will most likely side with FASA. I’m going to post some primer information on this site so you’ll know where things land. I’ll also be posting som HERO system stats for various characters and things, but I’ll need some help from my more HERO-fluent friends to make the conversions.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-hero-vs-how-much-fasa">How much HERO vs. How Much FASA</h2>

<p>The setting will come from the FASA materials, but the game itself will use the HERO system. This means that characters, races weapons and everything will need to be converted. Instead of choosing a species and having bonuses or penalties, players will purchase racial packages with points. They’ll do the same with their professions. To keep things open and give the players some freedom, we’ll try to keep these packages as cheap as possible. After all, I want toencourage alien player characters.</p>

<p>One thing that will not be converted is starship combat. FASA already did bunches of work on that, and I’m happy with it. Besides, our ship-to-ship battles will focus more on the characters than the ships. Once you pull out that starfield map and put ship counters down, the role-playing tends to give way to tactical playing. I’d rather keep my players in role-playing mode. This isn’t to say that we won’t use the system at all. It just won’t be used very much.</p>

<p>However, if the players want to convert some small vehicles for some reason, we can use those since they would be on the same map as the characters.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>As the game progresses, I’d like to post some Captain’s Log entries as a way of keeping track. We don’t play every week, so the blog format will help us remember where we were last time. Of course, since this site is built for the folks who play the game, you’ll have to be a member to comment or add a log.</p>
