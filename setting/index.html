<p class="lead">Our story begins in the area of space known as the Triangle on Stardate 2/0003.01, about a year-and-a-half after the Four Years War against the Klingons ended on Stardate 1/9806.13. The war spilled over into the Triangle, so every character will have some kind of connection to it. For reference, the five-year mission from the original TV series began on Stardate 2/0704.00, when Kirk took command of the Enterprise. For an explanation of stardates, see the footer on my <a title="Star Trek Timeline" href="http://briancribb.github.io/strpg-timeline/tl-react/">Star Trek Timeline</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Orion Class V Blockade Runner in Orbit. Drawing by Dana Knutson" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/orion-ship-orbit_dana-knutson-800-39cbdbe61.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/orion-ship-orbit_dana-knutson-400-39cbdbe61.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/orion-ship-orbit_dana-knutson-800-39cbdbe61.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/orion-ship-orbit_dana-knutson-1000-39cbdbe61.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>Another important detail is the Federation’s reaction to the Orion slave trade. After the industry became known to the UFP, the Federation Council voted unanimously to impose harsh sanctions against Orion companies, ports, and shipping interests that participate in the Green Slave trade. At the time of our game, The sanctions have just gone into effect and traders everywhere are freaking out.</p>

<p>Even worse for the Orions, a report is published on 2/0103.13 by Captain Christopher Pike which describes the slave trade in more detail. Once this report reaches the Federation Council, the UFP officially stops trading with all Orion planets. This eventually worked out in the Federation’s favor, but not before some businesses went under.</p>

<p>The end result of these events is a time of harsh change in the Triangle, as businesses try to adapt to new restrictions and lost trade. Larger companies with greater dependence upon UFP/Orion trade faced the most difficulty in making the necessary changes, and many failed completely. This created a perfect environment for small, independent traders to thrive.</p>

<h2 id="the-triangle">The Triangle</h2>

<p>There’s a lot to go over about the Triangle, but the simple description is that it’s an area of space between Klingon, Romulan and UFP territory. For a long time nobody wanted anything in that area due to the difficulty of living there, but pioneers from various races began to move in anyway.</p>

<p>The Triangle was relatively quiet place until the Klingons and the UFP dragged a war through it. Now the major governments are looking a little closer, and it makes the locals a bit nervous.</p>

<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>

<p>Our protagonists are agents of Starfleet Intelligence, tasked with establishing a covert presence in the Triangle. Whatever the players decide about their skills, they are Starfleet personnel who work undercover as civilian traders.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission">The Mission</h2>

<p>At this time, the entire area is covered under Orion Sector Intelligence. The Triangle doesn’t get its own department within Starfleet Intelligence for two more years.</p>

<p>SI connections in the Triangle are sparse, so the main characters are tasked with building up a trading company for use as a cover for intelligence operations. They’ll start with one ship, running cargo through the Triangle in an effort to build up the company while collecting intelligence for the UFP.</p>

<h2 id="weapons-and-technology">Weapons and Technology</h2>

<p>Phasers and photon torpedoes were only deployed on Starfleet vessels in the last year of the war, so they’re just over two years old for practical purposes. They’re rare in the Triangle, and possession of them signifies a connection to the UFP. (Keep in mind that this could be a criminal connection in the case of gun runners.)</p>

<p><img alt="Klingon firing a disruptor pistol" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/klingon-firing-disruptor-pistol-800-96feaea78.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/klingon-firing-disruptor-pistol-400-96feaea78.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/klingon-firing-disruptor-pistol-800-96feaea78.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/klingon-firing-disruptor-pistol-1000-96feaea78.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>The most common weapon in the Triangle is the laser, but Klingon disruptors can also be found. Civilian models are usually a generation behind whatever the military is using at the time. Most civilian ships are still using lasers and accelerator cannons for defense.</p>

<h2 id="supplies-and-food">Supplies and Food</h2>

<p><img alt="Ensign Riley with some space food" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/riley-space-food-800-5a73d55ab.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/riley-space-food-400-5a73d55ab.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/riley-space-food-800-5a73d55ab.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/riley-space-food-1000-5a73d55ab.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>Meals on most space vessels consist of reconstituted “space food” that we’ve seen on the original TV show and in other shows from the 1960’s. Food synthesizers cut small color-coded cubes from large cargo blocks of food material to match the nutritional needs of a given crew member.</p>

<p>Although it can provide nutrition for any race, it’s generally considered to be tasteless by every race. For this reason, spacers are always on the lookout for “real food” or even just a few spices. On the bright side, space food has no shelf life. It can be stored indefinitely, which is useful on long voyages.</p>

<h2 id="variety-of-species">Variety of Species</h2>

<p>The original series had a mostly human setting because painting someone blue every week just wasn’t practical with their budget. However, in our RPG those limitations don’t apply. This means that Andorians and Tellarites will be much more common than they were in the shows, and even more common than they are in the source materials for the FASA RPG. Vulcans will be less common since they live longer and reproduce much slower than the others.</p>

<p><img src="/strpg-hero/assets/img/pages/andorian-sketch.jpg" alt="Andorian Sketch from 1986" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" /></p>

<p>In the old days, Andorian antennae were in the back.
FASA games and the Enterprise series did admirable jobs of explaining the lack of a Klingon head ridge in the original series, but we’re not going to bother. In this game, imperial Klingons have always been the only kind of Klingon. So just imagine the guys from the old show with the funny foreheads. Same uniforms, same short haircuts, same beards… just with the current bumpy forehead.</p>

<h2 id="everybody-cant-live-forever">Everybody Can’t Live Forever</h2>

<p>Star Trek has a tendency to imply that everyone except humans lives practically forever. In reality, this is the same kind of issue as the makeup. There’s no way the Klingons from the original series would live all the way to the time of DS9… but the actors were available and we loved them. It was great fun to see them in those roles again, so we didn’t care much about the explanation.</p>

<p>“Okay, Klingons live forever just like everybody else around here, fine, whatever, holy crap it’s Koloth!“</p>

<p>But let’s be a little more fair. We can’t just keep everybody else around and trade out humans like paper cups. In this game, the only insanely long lifespan will belong to Vulcans. They need it more anyway, since they tend to have children only on purpose, and then probably only because of the pon far. Also, be careful not to mistake Spock’s lifespan for a Vulcan standard. He was regenerated on the Genesis planet, which probably added a few decades or more to the guy’s life.</p>

<p>As with other things, humans will be the baseline average with other races having a little more or a little less. Klingons have an especially poor life expectancy, but it’s kind of hard to get medical data on natural causes with all the stabbing going on…</p>

<h2 id="locals-and-landing-parties">Locals and Landing Parties</h2>

<p>In the show, characters were able to move around on various planets without raising a fuss because humans seemed to be everywhere. This is explained by that the most convenient excuse available in Star Trek: the Preservers. These folks were a race who developed before everyone else and took a liking to the younger species. In fact, they liked us so much that they kidnapped bunches of people and planted them on all sorts of planets. Supposedly this was to protect younger cultures from extinction. Or maybe it was all an elaborate xeno-sociology experiment. Or maybe it was a plot device.</p>

<p>There are Preserver ruins all over known space, from the Federation to the Triangle to the Romulan Empire. Do they look just like us but their history only goes back 1000 years? Preservers. Have you found that Romulan biology doesn’t match up with the other life on Romulus? Preservers. Did someone take your lunch from the company refrigerator? Preservers.</p>

<p>So it stands to reason that an under-developed planet could be populated by whatever race most is common on your ship. And of course it won’t even matter if you’re going to planets who are aware of the interstellar community.</p>

<h2 id="defacto-segregation-happens-sometimes">Defacto Segregation Happens Sometimes</h2>

<p>Even though it’s pretty common to have a mixed-up ship, sometimes people gravitate to voluntary assignments by species. For example, Andorians and Vulcans prefer not to serve together for long periods because their ideal temperatures are very different. It’s not a huge problem, but it’s not unheard of for a species to prefer the comfort of their own culture and thermostat settings.</p>

<p>This mostly applies to voluntary assignments, since Starfleet will assign a person to a position according to their career field with no regard for species. That being said, it’s considered a jerk move to assign Vulcans to ice planets unless it’s really necessary.</p>
