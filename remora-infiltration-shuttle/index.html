<p class="lead">This one-of-a-kind prototype was recently built for Starfleet Intelligence. It’s primary function is to attach itself to the hull of a much larger vessel while in orbit. Once in place, the pilot may enter the vessel through an airlock, listen to internal transmissions or even place explosives on the hull. (These tasks vary in difficulty with each target.) Once its work is complete, the Remora detaches from the target and returns to it’s parent vessel.</p>

<h2 id="flight-performance-and-attachment">Flight Performance and Attachment</h2>

<p>This shuttle is capable of achieving .57 light speed and is capable of surface landings. Although it’s far more agile in space, the Remora maneuvers similar to a standard shuttle while in atmosphere.</p>

<p>Attachment is achieved through he use of magnetic landing pads and a complex array of maneuvering thrusters. The pilot must match speed with the target to minimize the force behind initial contact. (This can be tedious and time-consuming.) The target must be significantly larger than the shuttle in order to avoid detection due to sluggishness at the target’s helm. Slightly smaller vessel attachments may be attempted if the target is in a standard orbit and is only making minor corrections to its position.</p>

<h2 id="stealth-systems">Stealth Systems</h2>

<p>To avoid electronic detection, the Remora is designed to reflect starship sensor emissions in odd directions rather than reflecting directly back to the source. Dark gray paint helps to conceal the shuttle from visual detection in space or on another ship’s hull, and a small shield generator can be used to absorb primitive radar. If the shuttle is mostly powered down and is using only its maneuvering thrusters, it can be easily mistaken for a small, inert object which would likely be turned away by navigational deflectors. Traveling slowly relative to the target vessel further reduces any concern that its sensor operator may have.</p>

<p>The stealth system is far from perfect, however. If a sensor technician is aware of the Remora and specifically searching for it, there is no way to avoid detection. A successful operation requires a pilot to avoid suspicion in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="size-and-configuration">Size and Configuration</h2>

<p>The Remora Class is much smaller than a standard shuttle. It has room for a pilot, a passenger and one-half of a standard cargo unit (3.375 cubic meters) for equipment. This cargo space is distributed into different compartments, so large items cannot be carried unless they’ll fit into the passenger seat behind the pilot.</p>

<p>Due to its size, the Remora does not have an airlock. To disembark in space, the pilot must wear an environmental suit and depressurize the cockpit. Cargo compartments are sealed for their protection, but any cargo in the passenger seat would be exposed. Two retractable tethers are installed on the craft, but the pilot may wish to wear magnetic boots or a thruster pack to maneuver.</p>

<h2 id="defense">Defense</h2>

<p>The Remora has a small shield generator which is designed to absorb more basic forms of detection such as radar. In times of dire need, more power can be applied to the shield for defensive purposes. This is useless against starships, but the shield can act as a navigational deflector and is able to turn away personal phaser fire for a short period of time. Be advised that using the shield in this way requires enough power to negate the benefits of all stealth systems onboard. Any nearby starship would be able to easily detect the shuttle and determine its position. Of course, this wouldn’t matter if the shuttle were on the surface of a planet in broad daylight.</p>

<p>The Remora is still able to take off and land with the shield at full power, but does not gain the full benefit of its engines.</p>
