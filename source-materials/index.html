<p>This is where I’ll be providing various things for the benefit of the game. There will be links to online resources, but I’m also going to copy star maps, floor plans and deck plans from the various FASA source books and publish them here. They tend to be scattered through all the various adventures and expansions, so it will be nice to have them in one place.</p>

<p>Ship Image</p>

<p>I’ve managed to get almost all of the FASA content on PDF. I’m providing these because they’ve been out of print for years, and you can only get them by finding someone on eBay who already has one. Just to be safe, these links will only be visible when you’re logged into the site. I don’t want to just give these things out to the World.</p>

<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>

<p>Although we will be using the HERO system, much of the content will come from this game. You really got a sense of your character’s career in this game, all the way from the academy to the current post.</p>

<p>It still used random dice rolls, however. A point-based system will provide control for players, but will balance the various races and skills. For example, Vulcan racial modifiers in the Star Trek RPG put them way ahead of everyone else. In the HERO system, they would have to spend points for their powers and advantages.</p>

<p>Media Objects</p>

<h2 id="source-books">Source Books</h2>

<p>The RPG gives a well-rounded view of the Star Trek universe, but these expansions fill in the gaps. They can be used to flesh out non-player characters, or they can be used to change the setting of the game entirely. If we wanted to, we could play as klingons, romulans, orions or even civilian traders.</p>

<p>Each expansion has its own maps, timelines and world entries. They go far beyond the game mechanics by providing coordinates and information on trade routes. As an added bonus, FASA took great care in keeping the various timelines synchronized. There are a few things that don’t quite match, but for the most part it’s pretty solid.</p>

<p>Media Objects</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>These books are more like booklets, really. They were included with adventure modules, but provide some really interesting information about Federation history. These don’t have game mechanics… they’re all story.</p>

<p>Media Objects</p>

<h2 id="ship-recognition-manuals">Ship Recognition Manuals</h2>

<p>These books have stats and diagrams of military and civilian ships going from the original series all the way to Star Trek III. But there’s more to them than that. They also have historical data about when the ships were used and why.</p>
