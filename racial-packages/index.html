<p class="lead">If you want to be something other than human, then here are some alternatives. Racial and cultural packages are separate, so it’s possible to choose play a catian who was raised on Andor. It’s weird… but it’s possible.</p>

<p>The exception would be Vulcans. It's <em>super-duper-<strong>DUPER</strong> rare</em> for a Vulcan to be raised in another culture and it's probably because they're of mixed ancestry like Spock. Even Spock was raised among Vulcans before flipping off his dad and joining the military, and he still stuck with Vulcan culture.</p>

<p><small><em>* The Cultural Knowledge skills in these packages have a zero cost because they are assumed to be the character’s home culture. Everyone gets their home culture as an Everyman skill.</em></small></p>

	<p>These are the blue people with the antennae. They'e a founding member race of the Federation and they're the source of much of it's military strength. Everything from combat training to the design of starship weaponry is strongly influenced by Andorian culture. Although they're a warrior race, they're just as dedicated to peace as anyone else in the Federation.</p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
		<h4>Hot Heads</h4>
		<p>Andorian history is full of conflict and war during the summer months. They eventually discovered that their species tends to become more aggressive and violent in warmer temperatures. Human room temperature norms are fine, but an Andorian spending any lenth of time on Vulcan would become irritable and easily agitated.</p>
		<p class="mb-0">This doesn't have any points attached to it because Andorians have learned to manage this sort of thing. It's just flavor for role-playing purposes.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Some FASA materials portray the Andorian antenna as a sensitive weak point for their species. This is kind of stupid, since they're a warrior race and those things are right on top of their heads, easily accessible to any opponent. In this game, they're no more sensitive to pain than human ears. Plus, antennae grow back if severed. Of course, hitting one will screw up the person's balance and composure for a moment, kind of like being poked in the eye. Except it's an ear. Well, sort of...</p>

Tellarites are the Federation's experts at fusion power technology and are difficult to beat in a good haggling session due to their love of argument.</p>

</div>
<div id="vulcans" class="collapse">
	<p>Everyone knows what Vulcans are, so I'll just go over the particulars of this game. Keep in mind that Spock was half human. He's a wild, violent hippie compared to the rest of his people. He also got a brand new body on the Genesis Planet, so we can't use his lifespan as an indicator for anything.</p>
	<p>The Vulcan nerve pinch will start small, but players can add points to it to make it more effective. <em>(Spock was <strong>really</strong> good at nerve pinches.)</em> The Mind Meld isn't even detailed here because frankly, it's a mess. It has so many limitations for that 1D6 that they're hardly worth writing down. Just trust me that it's cheap and remember what you saw on the show. We'll role-play it out. <em>(It's also cumulative, so that 1D6 can take you really far if nobody interrupts you.)</em></p>

	<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
		<h4>Mind melds are a two-way street.</h4>
		<p class="mb-0">That's one of the reasons why it's so cheap. Physical contact is required and anything bad that happens during the meld is shared equally by both parties. If the target is in pain, then everybody is in pain. If the target is having a psychotic episode... well, just make sure you can keep grip on yourself so your friends don't have to pull you away and put you in the corner for a few minutes.</p>
	</div>

	<p>If the target has a virus that you don't want to catch then it's possible to achieve a meld with gloves on. However, it requires considerable effort just to get started and nothing can be done through a glass wall. You would have to put on a sealed suit and go into the isolation room with the patient. <em>(I know that Spock once planted a suggestion in someone's mind from a distance in the show, but that was just a writing decision to move the plot along.)</em></p>

	<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
		<h4>Blocking pain can lead to trouble.</h4>
		<p>Pain blocking is part of the Vulcan racial package because it's part of their telepathic ability. They're essentially hypnotizing themselves. This can be a problem when a Vulcan is sick or injured because they don't like to show any reaction to pain or discomfort. They tend to block what they can and suffer the rest without complaint.</p>
		<p class="mb-0">It's not unheard of for a Vulcan with a serious problem to just block the pain until their body gives out. So if a Vulcan suddenly passes out at work, send them to sickbay for a full exam and a stern talking-to.</p>

<p>The Federation isn’t the only power represented in the Triangle. Romulans and Klingons are also around, although Romulans during this time are still mostly unknown to the UFP. Only the Klingons have dealt with them up close, due to their centuries of conflict.</p>

	<p>The Klingon supliment for the old FASA game was written by the same people who wrote the first Star Trek novels about Klingons. They created a rich, deep society that got tossed when Star Trek: The Next Generation came around. In this game, we're going to consider that to be a social shift over time. In our game, it's original Klingons with FASA culture.</p>

	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
		Klingons have strong bones and an armored spine, with a ridge leading all the way up the neck and over the skull. This means that the Klingon spine is less flexible than a human's, but is more resistant to damage. In game terms, this means -1 DEX is lost in exchange for 1pt of PD against blunt attacks.

	<p>As described on the <a title="Setting" href="/strpg-hero/setting/">Setting</a> page, there is only one kind of Klingon. FASA explained differences between the old show and the movies through genetically altered Human/Klingon fusions, meant to interact better with the UFP. But really... prosthetic makup was difficult for a TV show in the 60's so they just used constuming and facaial hair. They also painted the actors brown in most cases, which doesn't seem so good in retrospect. For our story, imagine the TNG Klingons in the old 1960's uniforms, and a wide range of skin colors.</p>

	<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
		Klingons in the FASA setting have shorter lifespans than humans, reaching adulthood at 12 years and beginning the physical decline of age in their forties. (For modern humans this happens in their fifties.) The true lifespan of the Klingon species is uncertain, however, because the data is skewed by all the stabbing.

	<h4>Klingon Cultural Package (7/0)</h4>
	<p>Due to their physical strengths and weaknesses, Klingons tend to focus on knife fighting. Hand-to-hand combat is something they do while searching for a blade, and that doesn't take long because everyone carries a knife at all times.</p>

	<p>FASA provided a comprehensive suppliment for the Orions, and it wouldn't surprise me if the Ferengi were just a little bit based upon them. The difference is that Orions like to spend money as much almost as much as they love to make it. They gain status by showing off how well they're doing and how many people they can take care of, but going bankrupt is unthinkable.</p>
	<p>Orions think of everything as a transaction, but they have strong loyalty for family and think of "value" as more than just money alone. They wheel and deal and haggle and bargain, and they're not too picky about how they get ahead.</p>
	<h4>The Green Slave Trade</h4>
	<p>The thing that's hardest to get about Orion culture is the practice of life-contracting, otherwise known as the Green Slave Trade. It's been part of their culture for thousands of years, and the Federation has been unable to stamp it out. When authorities try to enforce anti-slavery laws on Orion planets within the UFP, everyone denies that any slavery is going on. The Greens themselves will claim to merely be employees.</p>
	<p>Ruddy Orions are 35% of the population, with Greens making up the majority. Only Greens are slaves. Ruddies are the managerial class, and are always in charge. Greens are the labor force.</p>
	<p>Orions are the original capitalists, and they've worked the exploitation of workers pretty deep into the culture. On the bright side, an Orion who spends time in the UFP tends to see the value of space socialism. Perhaps with enough social exposure, the Federation can influence Orion culture to abandon old practices.</p>

	<h4>Orion Racial Package: Ruddy (5/-10)</h4>
	<p>Ruddy Orions are tall and slender, with skin colors ranging from deep ruddy orange to pale yellow. Their hair and eyes come in shades of gray, from pure white to charcoal black. They tend to be slender and prefer short hair or a shaved scalp.</p>

	<h4>Orion Racial Package: Green (5/-10)</h4>
	<p>Green Orions are also tall, but their builds are stronger and a life of manual labor gives them more muscle. Their skin comes in shades of green, and they have thick black hair with metallic green highlights. Body hair is common among males and famales, and is considered a mark of distinction.</p>
	<p>Green Orions also have a distinctive smell. It's not unpleasant, and is unnoticable after a few minutes. This is a powerful pheremone which is released from the Orion's mildly oily skin. This pheremone tends to relax humanoid races, but strong emotions can change the scent. A group of angry or frightened Greens can literally transmit their emotional state to others.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
		These pheremones don't cost any points because they're not strong eough for a single character to actively use and the effect is easily resisted by those who are aware. It only matters for large groups of Greens, so the power is basically a plot device. To simulate the individual effect, Greens have a slightly higher PRE and COM.

	<h4>Orion Cultural Package (10/0)</h4>
	<p>Orions will speak the language of the people they are selling to, and will tend to speak Orion only with each other. Every Orion speaks multple languages and is guaranteed to speak whatever non-Orion language is common to their area of space. They also start with the Trading skill, because their entire culture revolves around it.</p>
