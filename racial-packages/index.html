		<p>These are the blue people with the antennae. They'e a founding member race of the Federation and they're the source of much of it's military strength. Everything from combat training to the design of starship weaponry is strongly influenced by Andorian culture. Although they're a warrior race, they're just as dedicated to peace as anyone else in the Federation.</p>
		<p>Some FASA materials portray the Andorian antenna as a sensitive weak point for their species. This is kind of stupid, since they're a warrior race and those things are right on top of their heads, easily accessible to any opponent. In this game, they're no more sensitive to pain than human ears. Plus, antennae grow back if severed. Of course, hitting one will screw up the person's balance and composure for a moment, kind of like being poked in the eye. Except it's an ear. Well, sort of...</p>

They love to debate in the same way that Andorians love to spar, so it's important not to take their arguments personally. Tellarites are the Federation's experts at fusion power technology and are difficult to beat in a good haggling session due to their love of argument.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows what Vulcans are, so I'll just go over the particulars of this game. Keep in mind that Spock was half human. He's a wild, violent hippie compared to the rest of his people. He also got a brand new body on the Genesis Planet, so we can't use his lifespan as an indicator for anything.</p>
		<p>The Vulcan nerve pinch will start small, but players can add points to it to make it more effective. <em>(Spock was <strong>really</strong> good at nerve pinches.)</em> The Mind Meld isn't even detailed here because frankly, it's a mess. It has so many limitations for that 1D6 that they're hardly worth writing down. Just trust me that it's cheap and remember what you saw on the show. We'll role-play it out. <em>(It's also cumulative, so that 1D6 can take you really far if nobody interrupts you.)</em></p>
		<p>One important note, however: a mind meld is a two-way street. It's one of the things that makes it so cheap. It's hard to get into a person's mind, and anything bad that happens in there is shared equally by both parties. Remember in <em>Undiscovered Country</em> when Spock interrogated Valeris? When he went stomping around in her mind, he couldn't do anything without sharing it. He felt every bit of pain that he caused in there. So be careful if your target is mentally disturbed or in a volatile state of mind.</p>

		<p>Edoans were introduced in the Star Trek Animated Series along with the Catians. In the show they're orange, bald and had three arms/legs. That seems more than a bit silly to me, especially when I imagine them trying to run or sit down. For our game, we're going to do things a little differently.</p>
		<p>Edoans are the same as Saurians. (Yes, they make the famous brandy.) They have four arms, two legs, and they're cold-blooded. Everything else from the RPG sourcebooks remains unchanged. Their cold-blooded nature means that they'll need special clothing in colder environments. They're slightly smaller and lighter than a typical human, and are excellent climbers due to their extra limbs. They are vegetarians.</p>
