<p class="lead font-italic">*Edit: Although I've updated the map, the original information for the ship is from the FASA sourcebooks and is written from the perspective of the Star Trek films. Our campaign takes place before the original series, in the year that this class was introduced. I’ll most likely adjust that service date by five years so these vessels can be more common at the time of our story.<br />-BC*</p>

<p><img alt="Tavares Freighter landing. Drawing by Jim Nelson" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_jim-nelson-800-246a41b69.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_jim-nelson-400-246a41b69.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_jim-nelson-800-246a41b69.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_jim-nelson-1000-246a41b69.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>Designed as a light freighter, the Tavares Class has served Star Fleet for 23 years in that capacity. With a cargo capacity of 45,000 tons, these ships ply the spacelanes carrying out the duties of the Materiel Command. These vessels are not only used by Star Fleet but are also to be found in the civil sector. The 1,226 vessels produced for Star Fleet account for only one-fourth of the total built. These small freighters can usually be seen at any starport throughout the Federation and the Triangle.</p>

<p><a href="/strpg-hero/assets/files/Tavares_Deck_Plans.pdf"><img alt="Tavares Class II Commercial Freighter" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_class_II_freighter-800-d4e9808cd.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_class_II_freighter-400-d4e9808cd.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_class_II_freighter-800-d4e9808cd.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares_class_II_freighter-1000-d4e9808cd.jpg 1000w"></a></p>

<p>The Type O is a research vessel specially built for Star Fleet Intelligence Command. You can see the <a href="/strpg-hero/assets/files/Tavares_Deck_Plans_Updated.pdf">specifications and deck plans in this PDF</a>.</p>

<p>Though they appear to be identical to visual and casual sensors scan, these ships use a different warp and impulse drive system that allows them to travel at considerably higher warp speeds and gives them a more efficient manuever capability than the standard model. To get this increase in the vessel’s performance, sacrifices were made in the cargo capacity and in some crew comforts.</p>

<p>This model carries a bank of two phasers mounted in the bow and disguised in the forward sensor array; this mounting is so well concealed that it is virtually impossible to detect on a sensor scan unless the weapon is operational. Though considered by some to be “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” the Tavares is hardly that, considering its weak superstructure and lack of extensive armament.</p>

<p><img alt="Tavares Freighter traveling through a system. Drawing by Jim Nelson" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares-in-system_jim-nelson-800-3ef5d9cec.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares-in-system_jim-nelson-400-3ef5d9cec.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares-in-system_jim-nelson-800-3ef5d9cec.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/tavares-in-system_jim-nelson-1000-3ef5d9cec.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>Of the 1,226 Type II vessels built for Star Fleet,985 remain in active service, while 72 have been scrapped, 122 lost for various reasons, 40 sold to the private sector. The seven that were converted to Type O models remain in operation somewhere.</p>

<p>The Tavares takes its name from a late 20th-century personality responsible for the Terran movement to populate the nearby planets and thus begin their expansion into the galaxy.</p>

<h2 id="deckplan-details">Deckplan Details</h2>
<p>The original plans didn’t match up properly and didn’t always make sense, so I went into Photoshop and played around until I got it right.</p>

<p>All deck plans are based upon the <strong>Standard Cargo Unit</strong>. One SCU is 1.5 meters on a side and 3 meters tall, for 6.75 cubic meters. This means that all decks have a ceiling of less than 3 meters to account for the thickness of the floors, and evened out for cases where part of the map is two decks tall, like the shuttlebay.</p>

<p>Engineering has a slightly higher ceiling than a normal deck because of the shape of the ship. (Check out the cross section on the map.)</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Assume that there's infrastructure in the floors and ceilings that somehow make all of the heights work out to some kind of standard ceiling height. And please pretend that the walls are actually thicker than just a black line. I couldn't correct that without drawing a new map from scratch because it would scale up everything.
</div>

<h3 id="all-decks">All Decks</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Turbolift</dt>
	<dd>A central turbolift goes from Deck 1 to Deck 5. One can exit forward or aft depending upon the floor, and one can exit in either direction on Decks 2 and 3.</dd>
	<dt>Ladder</dt>
	<dd>In case of trouble with the turbolift, a ladder runs the entire length of the turbolift shaft.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-one-cargo-bay">Deck One: Cargo Bay</h3>

<p>Most of this deck is open space for cargo storage, and the room extends upward into Deck 2. A large door can be lowered and extended to the ground to act as a ramp for loading cargo.</p>

<p>To make use of the space above the cargo transporters, an open second floor loft was installed for additional cargo. Anything that’s taller than one deck would need to go into the aft portion of the bay, and would need to be loaded via the back door.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Cargo Transporters</dt>
	<dd>If the ship is in orbit, cargo can be brought onboard via the cargo transporters. This requires cooperation from the ground, since cargo needs to be marked for transport. The crew can  easily transport items from here to the personnel transporter on Deck 3, and transponders can be used transport cargo anywhere in the ship. This is often done to move cargo to the shuttlebay when large amounts of cargo must be stored. Never try it without the transponders, however. Transporters in this era are not as precise as the ones in the TNG era.</dd>
	<dt>Anti-grav Lifts</dt>
	<dd>Any trade vessel will have a number of personal anti-grav units laying around, but those are just handles that crew can use to move one crate at a time. These lifts are larger and can be used kind of like a palette jack to move larger amounts of cargo at once. They're also used as forklifts, turning up the power to lift cargo to the loft above. A crew member may ride on the lift or control it remotely with a handheld device.</dd>
	<dt>Charging Tracks</dt>
	<dd>The anti-grav lifts lock into these tracks for charging, but they also allow the lifts to be used as a simple elevator. When raised, the lifts will automatically match height with the loft, allowing cargo to be easily moved to or from.</dd>
	<dt>Landing Gear</dt>
	<dd>Forward landing gear is external of this deck, but the lower portion of the aft landing gear is accessible from small tool rooms on either side of the cargo bay.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-two-cargo-bay-loft">Deck Two: Cargo Bay Loft</h3>

<p>This is an open second floor within the cargo bay, built to make use of the space above the cargo transporters. The turbolift can be entered from either side, and the forward landing gear can be accessed for maintenance and repair.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Landing Gear</dt>
	<dd>When the landing gear is raised, it can be accessed from this deck. There's a hallway in the foreward section with access hatches to the gear.</dd>
	<dt>Water Storage</dt>
	<dd>The tanks on the starboard side are just for water. When full, these tanks can supply the ship with plenty of water without any need for rationing. This includes the sinks, toilets, mopping floors, whatever.</dd>
	<dt>Septic, Treatment and Liquid/Gas Storage</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>These three tanks are where the fun happens. One is a septic tank, which is where the **bad stuff** comes down, gets processed in the next tank and the freshly cleaned water goes over to the water storage tanks. We're about fifty years before replicators are invented, so individual toilets are unable to simply make the bad stuff "go away". However, the septic tank can be emptied by transporting it out and just never rematerializing it. The resulting energy is recycled through the ship's systems. Assume that there are special transponders in the tank to help with this.</p>
		<p>The tank nearest the wall is actually an arrangement of smaller tanks which contain whatever industrial gasses or liquids that the plot requires. Coolants are a good example of this.</p>
	</dd>
	<dd>These areas are made to look like more machinery for the landing gear, but they're empty. Hidden access panels can be removed to store more cargo, and a thin layer of fake machinery inside will shield the empty area from casual scans.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-three-bridge-deck">Deck Three: Bridge Deck</h3>

<p>This deck contains the bridge, and the lower portion of the shuttlebay, along with some other necessary equipment. If guests are brought onboard, they will be led directly to the turbolift and sent to the living quarters on the upper decks. All other doors would be locked. Guests who arrive by shuttle would be taken to the turbolift through the repair shop.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Bridge</dt>
	<dd>The bridge stations are on a raised platform in the forward part of the room. There are four standard stations in front which could be configured for any position, and two larger stations in the back which have more screens and indicators available. It's most common to put the engineering and science stations in the back to make use of the extra workspace, with helm, navigation and communications up front.</dd>
	<dt>Transporter Room</dt>
	<dd>This is the standard transporter room from the old Star Trek TV show. The controls are tied into the sensors so it could be used as a backup science station, but the equipment is meant for getting transporter locks so it won't be as good as the science station on the bridge.</dd>
	<dt>Computer Room</dt>
	<dd>This is the primary computer system for the entire ship. A ship's recorder buoy is mounted inside the bulkhead and can be jettisoned into space if you're absolutely sure that you're <strong>totally</strong> going to die and you want someone to read your desperate, final words.</dd>
	<dt>Battery Room</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Batteries can run the ship's essential systems and are kept charged by the warp engines. This is why you don't immediately lose life support when the engines are offline. <em>Batteries last until the plot requires them to run out.</em></p>
		<p>Since this is the fancy Type O model of the Tavares, the Battery Room contains hidden panel on the forward wall which leads to a secret transmitter room. This soundproof room has a viewscreen with a small transmitter control panel which can be used to send coded messages. There's also room for contraband behind the batteries.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Shuttlebay</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The shuttlebay covers two decks and is large enough for several standard size shuttlecraft. The doors are two decks high and the opening is protected by the standard magical force field system that lets Star Trek dock shuttles without pumping huge amounts of air into and out of a hangar. For game purposes, assume that the doors can be opened without losing air pressure, as long as the power is on.</p>
		<p>There are also small tractor beam emitters in the upper portion (both external and internal) which are used to assist with landing. These aren't strong enough to grab anything outside of the ship, but it's enough to move shuttles around in an effort to make room for more.</p>
		<p>If the crew keeps a shuttlecraft around on a regular basis, then fuel would be stored in the bay near a portable refueling unit.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Repair Shop</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This room contains the required machinery and equipment for repairing shuttlecraft and other vehicles. It can also be used to machine new parts. There are plenty of personal anti-grav units <em>(the little handles)</em> and larger units which can be stuck to the sides of a vehicle to move it around by hand. Just imagine a 1960's sci-fi version of whatever an automobile mechanic would use. It's all in there.</p>
		<p>The tractor beam emitters in the shuttlebay can be used to move a vehicle into the repair shop, but after that the crew would have to move it around with anti-grav units.</p>
	</dd>
	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
		Keep in mind that the shuttlebay is two decks tall and the repair shop is one deck tall, so anything larger than a standard shuttlecraft would have to be repaired in the bay.
	</div>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-four-engineering">Deck Four: Engineering</h3>

<p>Engineering is <strong>really</strong> important on a starship, so an entire deck has been dedicated to it. However, due to it’s ample supply of open space, some traders have been known to keep cargo in there. They shouldn’t, but they do…</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Weapons</dt>
	<dd>The Tavares isn't supposed to have weapons, so this section is made to look like additional sensor equipment. Fortunately for the engineer, there's plenty of room to walk around.</dd>
	<dt>Warp Core</dt>
	<dd>This is where the antimatter reactions happen, so it's basically a horrifying bomb in the middle of your only protection from the vacuum of space. Fortunately, dilithium crystals regulate things to prevent <strong>Bad Things</strong> from happening. From here, power is sent to the warp engines for distribution to the rest of the ship.</dd>
	<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
		If shenanigans occur then the aft section can be sealed off from the rest of Engineering. If things get <strong>really</strong> bad, then the warp core can be dropped into the floor and jettisoned from a port on the starbord side of the ship. After that, you're on battery power until you get a new warp core.
	</div>
	<dt>Hidden Compartments</dt>
	<dd>There are two smuggler's compartments in engineering which could be used for whatever is needed. Each is accessed by a hidden panel, same as the other hidden areas on the ship.</dd>
	<dt>Shuttlebay View</dt>
	<dd>There's a window on the aft wall that allows an engineer to see the entire shuttlebay. There are also controls for the tractor beam emitters here, so a shuttle can be assisted even if there's no one in the shuttlebay. Of course the window can be covered if you don't want to give people in the shuttlebay a view of the engineering section.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-five-crew-quarters">Deck Five: Crew Quarters</h3>

<p>This is where the crew lives, and contains the common areas shared by passengers.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Stairs</dt>
	<dd>There are stairs on either side which lead up to the passenger deck. They go forward to a landing and then turn inward. This part of the ship isn't in line with the turbolift, so the stairs are the only way to reach the next deck.</dd>
	<dt>Crew Quarters</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>There are seven crew cabins on this deck, each with their own head. <em>(Having your own bathroom is a big deal on independent trade ships, so be grateful.)</em> Every cabin has a cabinet for storage, as well as storage space under the bed. The two larger cabins have enough space for their own computer work station and a double bed. These will probably be assigned to the captain and perhaps the cargomaster.</p>
		<p>On the map, every other cabin is shaded to make it easier to tell them apart.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Laundry</dt>
	<dd>Replicators didn't show up until <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, so spacers are still going to do laundry for at least another fifty years. New clothing can be made by fabricators in the repair shop if raw materials are available, but existing clothing is kept until it wears out. This room has a washer, a dryer and three folding tables.</dd>
	<dt>Library</dt>
	<dd>For crew members who don't have their own computer terminal, there are two provided in this room. There's also a large, comfortable chair in the corner.</dd>
	<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
		All Star Trek desktop computers are dumb terminals which are connected to the ship's computer, so a more relaxed crew could look things up at their workstation on the bridge, in engineering or wherever. Tabletop terminals are for personal use and for meetings.
	</div>
	<dt>Galley</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The Tavares, sadly, is not a luxury craft. The galley is just an open area with a table and a food dispenser. The dispenser stores and distributes boring, tasteless <em>space food</em> as described on the <a title="Setting" href="/strpg-hero/setting/">Setting</a> page. On the bright side, the cubes of space food can be dispensed hot or cold as desired.
		</p>
		<p>There's a communal head along the forward wall with a double-sink, which allows people to wash up without going into anyone's quarters. It also has a full cabinet for supplies.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Sickbay</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This is a well-stocked sickbay for such a small ship. There are two standard medical beds with status screens above them, and some vague sci-fi medical equipment that a character might use in the old TV show. The upper half of the forward wall is a large window that the doctor can use to observe their patients. The walls are soundproof, but an intercom system allows the doctor to hear if a patient calls. <em>(Or the door could just be left open.)</em></p>
		<p>The doctor's office has a desk and a small laboratory, with two locked cabinets for drugs and other valuable materials. These are all waist-high, allowing the doctor to see over them through the window.</p>
		<p>There are two doors in the office, allowing the doctor to enter without disturbing patients. The window can be covered if the doctor wishes.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Impulse Engine</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>This is a smaller engineering section just for the impulse engine. Everything can be controlled from the main engineering deck, but direct repairs must be made here. There are two smuggler's compartments in the forward part of the section which can be accessed via hidden panels. The door to the Impulse engine is locked by default, to prevent passengers from entering. There are also blast doors that can be closed in case of Dramatic Shenanigans.</p>
		<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
			The impulse engine can't be jettisoned, but it can be sealed off from the rest of the deck. Assuming that the regular door isn't enough, there are heavy blast doors that can be used to force an explosion to go out the back of the ship rather than into the crew deck.
		</div>
		<p>Fortunately, the smuggler's compartments are forward of the blast doors. <em>(Accessible through the same type of hidden panel as the other hidden compartments.)</em> If the impulse engine blew out, any contraband would likely be intact. Probably.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="deck-six-guest-quarters">Deck Six: Guest Quarters</h3>

<p>Ideally there wouldn’t be any important equipment on a passenger deck, but the ship just isn’t large enough to make that kind of room onboard. The forward and aft compartments are locked by default to prevent passengers from accessing the sensors or the shield generator.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Stairs</dt>
	<dd>There are stairs on either side which lead down to the crew deck. The go outward to a landing and then turn aft. This part of the ship isn't in line with the turbolift, so the stairs are the only way to leave the passenger deck.</dd>
	<dt>Guest Quarters</dt>
	<dd>There are four guest rooms on this deck, with larger beds (though not as large as a double) and their own computer terminals with guest access to the ship's computer. The chairs in these rooms are larger and more comfortable than the standard work chairs in the rest of the ship.</dd>
	<dt>Sensors</dt>
	<dd>This is where the crew could get into trouble if they allow a stranger to conduct repairs. The weapons on Deck 4 are designed to look like a sensor array, but the actual sensor equipment must be stored somewhere. This machinery is designed to look like support systems for the shield generator, but the truth will be quickly discovered by any engineer who gains access to it.</dd>
	<dt>Deflector Shield Generator</dt>
	<dd>Larger ships have a separate generator for each of the six shield facings, but the Tavares doesn't have the room. Emitters are distributed, but all shield power comes from this one generator. This includes the navigational shields.</dd>
