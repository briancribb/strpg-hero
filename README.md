# strpg-hero
Resources for a Star Trek Role-playing Game with the old FASA setting but using HERO System 5th Edition for the mechanics.

I'm just dumping content in here from <code>strpg-hero-source</code> because I'm using some Jekyll plugins that aren't in the official GitHub list so it won't build remotely.
