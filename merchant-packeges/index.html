<p class="lead">There are three “lanes of entry” into the merchant profession: academies, apprenticeships and on-the-job training.</p>

<p><img alt="Trade Ship" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/trade-ship-800-d88a696be.jpg" srcset="/strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/trade-ship-400-d88a696be.jpg 400w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/trade-ship-800-d88a696be.jpg 800w, /strpg-hero/generated/assets/img/pages/trade-ship-1000-d88a696be.jpg 1000w" /></p>

<p>Merchant academies are the most respected way to get into the trading business, but they’re far from the only way. Some people are accepted into apprenticeships, while others simply jump onboard and work their way up from the bottom. Apprenticeships are the fastest, taking just three years by teaching only the essentials.</p>

<p>In either case, the character goes through the initial training and is then evaluated to see if they should continue. If a character washes out of an academy after the first two years, they can still try to get an apprenticeship for their specialty training. And if an apprenticeship doesn’t work out, there’s always enough hard work to go around.</p>

<p>For those who work their way up, just use the apprentice packages below and increase the amount of time required to complete them. On-the-job training takes longer than the other options. Without some lucky breaks, it can take far more than three years for a person to work their way up to the UFP/ITA certification test, and even more to reach the pay grade of an academy graduate.</p>

<h3 id="merchant-tickets">Merchant Tickets</h3>

<p>All of these paths lead to an Interstellar Merchant Ticket, which is an official merchant certification issued by the UFP/ITA after a big, scary test. It’s issued by facilities accredited by the UFP/ITA and is recognized throughout the UFP and the Triangle.</p>

<p>For captains and command personnel, an additional certification is required, known as a License to Master a Vessel in Space, more commonly known as a Master’s Ticket. This is considered a perk, but doesn’t require any points. It’s granted after a series of tests just like the merchant ticket, but in game terms the requirement is to have the skills from a Command School package.</p>

<h3 id="pay-grades">Pay Grades</h3>

<p>How you start affects where you end up. Those who can attend a merchant academy will graduate with a pay grade no lower than 4, while apprentices complete their programs with a minimum of Pay Grade 3. Although apprentices can get employment a year earlier, academy graduates will still have a lead where pay grades are concerned. As always, those who work their way up will have to earn each pay grade as they go.</p>

<h2 id="spending-points-and-using-packages">Spending Points and Using Packages</h2>

<p>These packages work the same way as their Starfleet counterparts. If anything overlaps, just take the highest one. for example, you don’t have to buy SysOp (Environmental Systems) more than once. If one school has a familiarity and the next has a full skill, then take the full skill. At the end of the process, you should have full skills and some familiarities. This should leave points afterward for skill levels if you want them.</p>

<h3 id="train-the-whole-way">Train the Whole Way</h3>

<p>The Merchant’s Ticket perk is included with the basic package for academies and apprenticeships, but this assumes that the player has completed training in a specialty. Whatever lane a character takes, a full skill set is needed to pass the appropriate tests.</p>

<h2 id="merchant-academy-packages">Merchant Academy Packages</h2>

<p>Academies have a two-year general curriculum, followed by a two-year specialty program. There are numerous academies throughout the UFP, and more than enough accredited independent academies in the Triangle.</p>

		<p>Merchant academies spend two years on core skills and another two on specialty skills. The training isn't as advanced as Starfleet Academy training, but it's well-suited for civilian spacers. After the first two years, students are evaluated to see if they qualify for further training. A character who washes out may have to get a low-level position somewhere to continue training on-the-job.</p>

<h2 id="merchant-apprenticeship-packages">Merchant Apprenticeship Packages</h2>

<p>An apprenticeship lasts for three solar years. Apprentices are paired with trained, experienced UFP/ITA traders in active merchant work across the known galaxy. During the first 18 months, the apprentice is well-grounded in the general skills and studies necessary for every interstellar merchant. After that, they are evaluated before continuing with specialty training.</p>
